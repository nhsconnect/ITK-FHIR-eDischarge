## Introduction ##

The Transfer Of Care eDischarge  Specification supports the following care communications:

**eDischarge (inpatient discharge summary) Document** – An ITK FHIR Document containing Transfer of Care information supporting an inpatient discharge typically between an acute hospital and GP practice.
   
FHIR Messaging components specified within this site have been developed by NHS Digital and use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community.

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within England’s health and social care systems.

Find out more on the [INTEROPen website](http://interopen.org/).

This documentation provides a FHIR document implementation of the work done by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC) in defining headings for clinical documents.
