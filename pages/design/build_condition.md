## Overview ##
This section details the design approach using FHIR resources to support the PRSB heading model for a condition list. The condition resource is referenced via the List resource.

## Resources Used for Profile Design ##
The following FHIR resources are profiled to create the condition list.

- **[CareConnect-ITK-Condition-List-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-ITK-Condition-List-1)** - A CareConnect derived NHS Digital Profile for recording a snapshot of the list of Conditions for the patient.
- **[CareConnect-ITK-Condition-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-ITK-Condition-1)** -	A CareConnect derived NHS Digital Profile for conditions. The Condition resource records detailed information about conditions (diagnoses) recognised by a clinician.

## List ##
This resource acts as a container for the conditions. The following is an example of the main elements used:

- identifier - uniquely identifies this list of conditions (UUIDs)
- status - should always be "current"
- mode - should always be "snapshot" 
- subject - a reference to the patient whose condition list this is
- encounter - a reference to the context in which the list was created (the inpatient stay for example)
- date - when the list was prepared
- source - who or what defined the list
- entry - a reference to the condition resource entry

## Condition ##
This resource is used to record detailed information about a condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern.The following is an example of the elements that can be used: 

- identifier - uniquely identifies this condition (UUIDs)
- clinicalStatus - 	active, recurrence, inactive, remission, resolved etc
- category - for eDischarge this will normally be encounter-diagnosis
- Severity - subjective severity of condition
- code - identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis
- bodySite - anatomical location, if relevant
- subject - the patient
- onset - estimated or actual date, date-time, or age
- abatement - if/when in resolution/remission
- stage - stage/grade, usually assessed formally
- evidence - supporting evidence

## How the Condition List is Constructed ##
The condition list is constructed as a single list. The diagram below shows the Resources used and relationships between the Resources.

Each condition in the list will use the FHIR list resource Flag element to indicate the context of the condition (For example primary, secondary etc). 

**Important Note - The value set for the condition list flag element is currently under review and subject to change.**
