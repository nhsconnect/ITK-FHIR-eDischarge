summary: "Using MESH with Transfer of Care Documents"
---


## Overview ##

The Transfer of Care documents should be sent using [ITK over MESH](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/itk3messagedistribution-2-9-0/mesh.html) .

## Use of Demographic Composite GP Lookup on MESH ##

When sending a Transfer of Care document over MESH and the patient's GP practice is not known, then the Demographic Composite GP Lookup facility supported by MESH **SHOULD** be used. However, some identifier elements with in the document cannot be populated.

In this instance any identifier elements which require the Patient's GP practice ODS code should be populated with "V81999" to indicate "code not known".  
Recipients must not reject messages based on the use of the V81999 code. However, message initiators still need to ensure that what is entered into Composition.section.title and Composition.section.text in the [GP Practice section](explore_gp_practice.html) makes sense when read by a human.
