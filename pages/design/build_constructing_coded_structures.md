## What is a Coded Clinical Structure ##

A coded clinical structure is a FHIR resource or a number of resources populated with the elements required to define a discreet clinical concept or group of concepts, for example an allergy or a list of allergies. The coded structure will be referenced from a document section and may also reference another coded clinical structure or structures.
