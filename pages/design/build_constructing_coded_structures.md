## What is a Coded Clinical Structure ##

A coded clinical structure is a FHIR resource or resources populated with the elements required to define a discreet clinical concept or group of concepts, for example a allergy or a list of allergies. The ITK eDischarge Bundles do not contain any such structures and the relevant payload specification should be consulted for more information.
