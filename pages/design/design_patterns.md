# Patterns #

This section has been included to emphasise the use of design patterns in to the process of deciding how to use ITK eDischarge within ITK Messaging Solutions. The information has been taken from [developer.nhs.uk](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/architecture/integration-patterns/information-sharing-patterns-summary/).

## Overview ## 

A “pattern” is a formal way of documenting a solution to a design problem in a particular field of expertise for example in the case of an ITK Messaging Solution sharing clinical information between systems. The information in this section has been reproduced and shortened from [developer.nhs.uk](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/architecture/integration-patterns/information-sharing-patterns-summary/)
- Patterns are not mutually exclusive: many real solutions will use more than one pattern.
- Solutions may evolve from simpler to more complex patterns over time.
- Some patterns will be better for specific sharing needs than others – there is no “one size fits all”.
- Some patterns will scale better to larger populations.
- Some patterns require additional capabilities or services to be in place.

## List of patterns ##

Below is a list of patterns. If you require more detail please go to [developer.nhs.uk](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/architecture/integration-patterns/information-sharing-patterns-summary/) and click on the pattern for more information.
