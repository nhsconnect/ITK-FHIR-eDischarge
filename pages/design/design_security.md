## What is ITK Messaging Solution Security? ##

ITK Messaging Solution Security often encapsulates authentication and encryption. However, various concepts requiring diverse expertise and approaches need to be considered especially concerning testing and quality:

- Authentication: reliably identify end user
- Authorisation: identified user access to correct resources/data 
- Encryption: hide information from unauthorized access
- Signatures: ensure information integrity

Two common ways of accessing and managing ITK Messaging Solution security based on the need to balance access to ITK Messaging Solutions with the permissions to access the information contained within the ITK FHIR Documents and messages include:

- Federation: reusing Credentials & Spreading Resources
- Delegation: access and rights can be given to authorized users

## Authentication and Authorisation ##

Authentication and authorisation are commonly used together:

- Authentication: reliably identify end user
- Authorisation: identified user access to correct resources/data 

Authentication is most often implemented with a user-name and password. To increase the security this can be supplemented by adding 

- software certificates, 
- hardware keys and 
- external devices. 

Authorisation occurs once the user is authenticated, the system decides which resources or data to allow access to.

## Security and ITK Messaging Solutions ##

Security is a key consideration when establishing ITK Messaging Solution projects and should be considered within the design from the start of any project. The four key principles to consider are:

- Authentication
- Authorisation
- Encryption
- Signatures
