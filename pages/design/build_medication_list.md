## Overview ##
This section details the design approach using FHIR Resources to support the PRSB heading model for medication and devices.


## Medication Snapshot ##
The medication list is a “Snapshot” of the medication at a point in time (for example on discharge from hospital). It is not a master list of the patient’s medications. Other lists of medications for the patient may exist on other systems. For Transfer of Care Documents there will a potentially be two lists one for active medication and one for discontinued medication. There are two entries in the FHIR Composition.section.text element:

- medication item entries which map to the Medication Statements in the active list 
- Medication discontinued entries which map to the Medication Statements in the discontinued list

## Resources Used for Profile Design ##
The FHIR Resources are profiled to create the medication list as below:

- **[CareConnect-ITK-Medication-List-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-ITK-Medication-List-1)** - An NHS Digital Profile for recording a snapshot of the list of Medications for the patient.
- **[CareConnect-ITK-MedicationStatement-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-ITK-MedicationStatement-1)** - An NHS Digital Profile for medication statements. The MedicationStatement Resource is a record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.
- **[CareConnect-ITK-Medication-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-ITK-Medication-1)** - An NHS Digital Profile for medication. The Medication Resource is primarily used for the identification and definition of a medication.

## List ##
This Resource acts as a container for the medication items. The following is an example of the elements which can be used:

- identifier - uniquely identifies this list of medication (UUID)
- code - the type of list (SNOMED CT concept for "active medication" or "discontinued medication")
- status - should only be "current"
- mode - should only be "snapshot"
- title - descriptive name for the list
- subject - a reference to the patient whose medication list this is
- encounter - a reference to the context in which the list was created (the inpatient stay)
- date - when the list was prepared
- source - who or what defined the list
- entry - a reference to the MedicationStatement Resource entry or entries
- flag - **MUST  NOT be used for Transfer of Care**
- emptyReason - **MUST  NOT be used for Transfer of Care** if list is empty do not send a List.


## MedicationStatement ##
A record of a medication that is being consumed or has been consumed by a patient. The following is an example of the elements that can be used:

- identifier - uniquely identifies this medication statement (UUID)
- clinicalStatus - should always be active
- category - should be inpatient
- medication - the medication coded (a SNOMED CT Concept that identifies this medication), this is done by reference to the Medication Resource which details the medication. 
- effective - the date/time or interval when the medication was taken
- dateAsserted - When the statement was asserted defaults to composition date
- informationSource - Person or organization that provided the information about the taking of this medication, assumed to be composition author
- reasonCode - Reason for why the medication is being/was taken
- subject - The Patient
- reasonReference - a reference to the Condition Resource that supports why the medication is being/was taken
- medicationReference - a reference to the Medication Resource
- taken - default to "unknown" or "na" if the taken element is not applicable for the medication or device
- reasonNotTaken - **MUST NOT be used for Transfer of Care** 
- dosage - Details of how medication is/was taken or should be taken

## Medication ##
The Medication Resource allows for medications to be characterized by the form of the drug and the ingredient (or ingredients), as well as how it is packaged. The medication will include the ingredient(s) and their strength(s) and the package can include the amount (for example, number of tablets, volume, etc.) that is contained in a particular container (for example, 100 capsules of Amoxicillin 500mg per bottle). The following is a example of the elements that can be used:

- code - a SNOMED CT Concept that identifies this medication
- form - powder, tablets, capsule etc SNOMED CT form concepts 
 
## How the Medication List is Constructed ##
The medication record is constructed as two lists. The diagram below shows the Resources used and the relationship between the Resources.

## MedicationStatement ##

This section gives guidance of the use of the MedicationStatement Resource. Sending Systems should send as much details as they can. 

## MedicationStatement.dosage.route ##
Constraint: NHS e-Prescribing route of administration subset refset 999000051000001100.
The route can be any route, and not constrained to a dm+d route for the medication. Separate products are different MedicationStatements in Primary Care if the same product have multiple route options then the routes go in the FHIR element <b>MedicationStatement.dosage.text</b>. When using routes outside the stated ValueSet, then use FHIR element <b>MedicationStatement.dosage.text</b>.

## MedicationStatement.dosage.site ##
Constraint: As per the FHIR ValueSet <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/valueset-approach-site-codes.html">approach-site-codes</a>. Site may have similar content as Route - There may be some overlap with Route (e.g. intra ocular left eye). If no code, then use the FHIR element <b>MedicationStatement.dosage.text</b>

## MedicationStatement.dosage.method ##
This <b>MUST NOT</b> be used in Transfer of Care, carry in the FHIR element <b>Composition.section.text</b> use the FHIR <b>MedicationStatement.dosage.text</b>
Short term this should be deprecated to a text string & concatenated with the dose direction (above).

## MedicationStatement.dosage.timing ##

**MUST NOT** be used in Transfer of Care, but is captured as part of the FHIR element <b>MedicationStatement.dosage.additionalInstruction</b> string. 

## MedicationStatement.dosage.text ##
A single plain text phrase describing the entire medication dosage and administration directions, including dose quantity and medication frequency. e.g. "1 tablet at night" or "20mg at 10pm" This is the form of dosage direction text normally available from UK GP systems.

## MedicationStatement.effective[x].effectivePeriod ##

If available may be carried in the FHIR element <b>MedicationStatement.effective[x].effectivePeriod</b>.

## MedicationStatement.dosage.patientInstruction ##

Specific patient instruction may use <b>MedicationStatement.dosage.patientInstruction</b>

## MedicationStatement.status ##

The FHIR element <b>MedicationStatement.status</b> is fixed to "active" for active medication lists and "stopped" for discontinued medication lists.

## MedicationStatement.reasonCode ##
**MUST NOT** be used in Transfer of Care.

## MedicationStatement.effectiveDateTime ##
Used to indicate when the medication was discontinued or became active.

## MedicationStatement.category ##
This FHIR element should carried the value "inpatient" for Discharge Documents and "outpatient" for Outpatient Letters.

## MedicationStatement.taken ##

This FHIR element should contain a value from the FHIR ValueSet <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/medication-statement-taken"> medication-statement-taken</a> to indicate whether the patient has taken the medication. For Transfer of Care the default is unk - unknown or if a value is not applicable then na - not applicable. 

## Medication Resource ##
This section gives guidance of the use of the Medication Resource

## medication.code ##
This FHIR element is mapped to the PRSB medication name

constraint: MedicationName.   Any AMP/VMP/VTM/AMPP/VMPP subsets from the dm+d terminology. 

<table style="width:100%;max-width: 100%;">

## medication.form ##
This form is on the medication profile. Where VTM has form specified (coded) it goes here.
AMP & VMP don't need separate Form (it is optional to populate). For VTM the form could be in MedicationStatement.dosage.text (as it would be part of a dosage string) i.e. not a separately specified code.

Constraint: DrugDoseForm. SNOMED CT CfH DoseForm termset. Constraint binding: [SNOMED CT]subset=CfH  DoseForm (refset 999000781000001107)
