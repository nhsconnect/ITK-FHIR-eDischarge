## Overview ##

The Test section contains descriptions of approaches and suggestions for building ITK ITK Messaging Solution.

| Page              |  Description    |
|+---------------------|+--------------------------------+|
| Patterns / Topology | Describes access patterns necessary which influence the access, security and use of ITK ITK Messaging Solutions. Depending on the pattern or topology of the sending and receiving system. The relationship between the sender and receiver influences the choice of access mechanism, security of payload etc. |
| Access | The access mechanism and of sending system is influenced by many factors. This section demonstrates the design decisions to consider | 
| Security | The security of the FHIR payload, access and data at rest are all important design decisions while building a ITK ITK Messaging Solution. | 
| Test Data | The test data allows the testing of the ITK eDischarge components and functionally at the individual response level. |
