## Overview ##

Implementers can obtain assurance of their FHIR messages through the Solutions Assurance team at NHS Digital. 
A process has been defined to allow conformance certification to be achieved for senders with the use of an ITK3 Test Harness. In addition, some GP Foundation IT suppliers have stood up their solutions in the INT environment to allow end-to-end testing. Testing against the Harness or GP solution involves the initial setup of MESH mailboxes.   
For details of what is required please contact the Solutions Assurance team using the email: <a href="mailto:ITKConformance@nhs.net">ITKConformance@nhs.net</a>.
