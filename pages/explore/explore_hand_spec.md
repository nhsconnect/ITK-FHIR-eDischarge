## Overview ##

There are a number of extensions added to the ITK messageHeader profile which are referred to as the [Handling specification](https://nhsconnect.github.io/ITK3-FHIR-Messaging-Distribution/explore_hand_spec.html). These extensions are used to control messaging behaviour such as when to send an acknowledgement.
