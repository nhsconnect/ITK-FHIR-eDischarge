For further details about the use of message definitions and their proposed usage to help with versioning and managing changes for consumers please refer to the [Message Definitions Overview page in the ITK3 Messaging Distribution Specification](https://nhsconnect.github.io/ITK3-FHIR-Messaging-Distribution/explore_defs_overview.html)
